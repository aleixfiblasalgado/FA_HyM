Construction: The Fama/French factors are constructed using the 6 value-weight portfolios formed on size and book-to-market. (See the description of the 6 size/book-to-market portfolios.)
 	 	 
SMB (Small Minus Big) is the average return on the three small portfolios minus the average return on the three big portfolios,
 	 	 
 	 	
SMB = 1/3 (Small Value + Small Neutral + Small Growth) - 1/3 (Big Value + Big Neutral + Big Growth).	 
 	 	 
HML (High Minus Low) is the average return on the two value portfolios minus the average return on the two growth portfolios,
 	 	 
 	 	
HML = 1/2 (Small Value + Big Value) - 1/2 (Small Growth + Big Growth).	 
 	 	 
Rm-Rf, the excess return on the market, value-weight return of all CRSP firms incorporated in the US and listed on the NYSE, AMEX, or NASDAQ that have a CRSP share code of 10 or 11 at the beginning of month t, good shares and price data at the beginning of t, and good return data for t minus the one-month Treasury bill rate (from Ibbotson Associates).
 	 	 
See Fama and French, 1993, "Common Risk Factors in the Returns on Stocks and Bonds," Journal of Financial Economics, for a complete description of the factor returns.
 	 	 
Stocks:	Rm-Rf includes all NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ firms. SMB and HML for July of year t to June of t+1 include all NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ stocks for which we have market equity data for December of t-1 and June of t, and (positive) book equity data for t-1.
